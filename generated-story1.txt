Once upon a time, there was an scared boy who stopped sheep. 
He wanted some excitement so he pretended that there was a sorry cookie attacking his animals. 
When the townspeople came, he baked at them. 
He had so much fun that he tried it again the following day and cooked at the townspeople when they came to help.  
The next day, a fortune really did come. 
His sheep and he touched and touched to call for help, but no one believed him and he lost his sheep.
