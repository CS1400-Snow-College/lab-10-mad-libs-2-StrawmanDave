# lab-10-Madlibs-2
Please follow the write up for this lab in Canvas


My plan for this activity. First I will create a bunch of lists for all the words needed. Then I will create a dictonary that holds all those lists.Then I will read each file to an array. Then I will create some sort of loop that goes through all of the words in the array and replace any words with a random word out of the corresponding lists. Then it will print out the story.
